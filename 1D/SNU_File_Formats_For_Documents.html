<H1>SNU File formats for documents</H1>
<H2>SNU supports all file formats. This can get confusing for novice users. Here, we will explain</H2>
<H2>If you are unsure about what to get or you don't want to read this, try the PDF or ODT formats</H2>
<H1>ODT</H1>
<H2>ODT (Open Document Text) is an open-source document container made by the document foundation. It is compatible with most office suites, such as Microsoft Office (Office 97 and above) and LibreOffice</H2>
<H2>It contains all the features of a Microsoft Word document, but it has minimal compression</H2>
<H1>DOCX</H1>
<H2>DOCX (Microsoft Office Document) is a closed-source document container made by Microsoft for Microsoft Office 2007 and above. It is NOT compatible with Microsoft Office 2003 or below, but despite it being made by Microsoft, it is still fully compatible with LibreOffice</H2>
<H1>PDF</H1>
<H2>PDF (Portable Document Format) is... well a portable document. It is compatible with most office suites and PDF readers, and is one of the dominant document formatting due to its compression and wide availability</H2>
<H1>XPS</H1>
<H2>XPS is a file format made for Microsofts XPS viewer. It is not compatible with many software distributions such as LibreOffice</H2>
<H1>RTF</H1>
<H2>RTF (Rich Text Format) is a document format made by Microsoft to work with Microsoft Write and Wordpad. It allows for rich text and high compatiblity with Microsofts products</H2>
